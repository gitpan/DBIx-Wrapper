Version 0.11
        * $db->update() and $db->nativeQuery() now return the number
          of rows affected by the query, if available.

	* 'make test' no longer breaks when DBI is not installed.
	  This was causing ActiveState Perl builds to fail and not be
	  available on their site.

Version 0.10
	my $rv = $dbh->delete($table, \%keys)
        my $id = $dbh->getLastInsertId;
        my $val = $dbh->nativeSelectValue($query, \@exec_args);
        my $rv = $dbh->smartReplace($table, \%data);
        my $row = $dbh->selectFromHash($table, \%keys);
